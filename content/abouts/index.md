Ingredients
=============

Information on frequently appearing **additives** and **electrolytes** in pre-workout supplements we recommend.
Yes, we've made sure they are *harmless* to the human body!

Additives
-------------

### Citric Acid
>Manufacturers use citric acid to make their pre-workout powders more water soluble. Otherwise, you would have a hard time mixing them with liquids.

### Calcium Silicate and Silicon Dioxide
> Both are anti-caking agents that absorb moisture and allow powder to flow freely.

### Cellulose gum
> A thickening agent, a completely natural product that is derived from the cell walls of plants. Typically it comes from wood pulp and cotton seeds. it can also be used as a stabilizer in food and non-food products. It can reduce acidity, pH balance, also used as an absorbing agent. It can absorb a certain amount of oil in fried foods and it absorbs water up to 20 times of its weight. For this reason it is sometimes used to maintain the moisture in certain foods as well.

### Xanthan Gum 
> Typically used for its ability to thicken or stabilize packaged goods.

### Carrageenan
> A natural emulsifier made from red seaweed and is used in food products to add thickness and viscosity.


Electrolytes
-------------

### Magnesium Chloride 
> Helps You Recover From Exercise Quicker

### Sodium Citrate
> The ingestion of 0.5 g of sodium citrate/kg body mass shortly before a 5 km running time trial improves performance in well trained college runners. (Oöpik V, Saaremets I, Medijainen L, Karelson K, Janson T, Timpmann S. Effects of sodium citrate ingestion before exercise on endurance performance in well trained college runners. Br J Sports Med. 2003 Dec;37(6):485-9. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.37.6.485. PMID: 14665584; PMCID: PMC1724692.)

### Sodium Chloride
> Reduce your risk of being depleted of sodium, especially during the first 60 to 90 minutes of training. Increase blood volume.

### Potassium and Magnesium
> Lowers blood pressure.

### Dipotassium Phosphate
> A convenient source of potassium, which contributes to your normal muscle function. is commonly used for the properties that make it effective as an emulsifier, stabiliser and texturiser.

### Disodium Phosphate
> Helps retain water/prevent dehydration

### Di-Caffeine Malate
> A patented ingredient from Creative Compounds, also known as Infinergy. a form of Caffeine that is buffered. It may be easier on the stomach, and it also helps with longer lasting energy as well as preventing the dreaded “crash” people may experience from Caffeine use.
