## 起源

**一份執著。一席來自醫師兼健身者的話。**

*"教練我平常晚上健身，喝了含咖啡因的補品怎麼睡得著？！"*

平日高頻率健身的黎醫師又一次聽到了其他健身人士這麼抱怨。**沒錯**。當前，台灣市面上可輕易購買的Preworkout不僅少之又少，其成分又時常難以符合健身民眾所需。

黎乃良醫師，一位執業25年的資深麻醉醫師，在51歲那一年踏入健身房，體脂肪從31降到14，一年內達到理想的體態，踏上比基尼健美比賽舞台。長年醫學背景，使他對健身以科學的理解去進行，為了達到最佳的體態效果，他接受了高強度的訓練和飲食控制，並使用有助鍛鍊的運動營養品。卻發現通過網路平台，購買國外的運動營養品，種類繁多，成分五花八門，對不同身體狀況或不同目標的人，要找到合適自己的pre workout，要花不少時間去搜尋，一般消費者如果沒有運動營養及醫學知識，會有一定程度的困難。

例如，pre workout有沒有含增肌成分；在減脂期要如何挑選pre workout；有睡眠障礙要注意什麼；平日服用的藥物會不會和pre workout產生交互作用﹒﹒﹒等等。

如果有一個平台，可以根據自身的情況及當時的目標，推薦適合的pre workout，對大多數的健身愛好者，是個省時省力的事情。

食品添加劑
Citric Acid
Manufacturers use citric acid to make their pre-workout powders more water soluble. Otherwise, you would have a hard time mixing them with liquids.

Calcium Silicate and Silicon Dioxide
Both are anti-caking agents that absorb moisture and allow powder to flow freely.

Cellulose gum, is a thickening agent, a completely natural product that is derived from the cell walls of plants. Typically it comes from wood pulp and cotton seeds. it can also be used as a stabilizer in food and non-food products. It can reduce acidity, pH balance, also used as an absorbing agent. It can absorb a certain amount of oil in fried foods and it absorbs water up to 20 times of its weight. For this reason it is sometimes used to maintain the moisture in certain foods as well.

Xanthan Gum food additive typically used for its ability to thicken or stabilize packaged goods

Carrageenan is a natural emulsifier made from red seaweed and is used in food products to add thickness and viscosity.

Tartaric Acid as a supplement doesn’t really make sense.
